                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p>This study aims to investigate the efficiency of different dehazing techniques in enhancing semantic
                    understanding in haze conditions with video data. We extract images from the BDD100K dataset and
                    simulate haze conditions using TCMonoDepth for video depth estimation and SeeingThroughFog with
                    varying beta values (0.05, 0.01, 0.02, 0.06) for haze generation. Four dehazing
                    techniques, namely MSBDN, Dehamer, Dehamer_indoor, and DCP, are applied to the hazed images.
                    Their performance is compared based on the Peak signal-to-noise ratio(PSNR) and Structural
                    Similarity Index Measure (SSIM) as an evaluation metric.</p>
                </br>
                <p> This results of this study are expected to provide insights into the most efficive dehazing
                    techniques for video data under hazing condition. It is also helping more powerful computer vision
                    application for challenges environmental condition. The results can also guide future research on
                    optimizing and improving dehazing methods for better semantic understanding under hazy conditions.

                <h1>Techniques</h1>
                <h2>Hazing Techniques</h2>
                <p>Although this study focuses on dehazing techniques, it is important to understand the process of
                    generation synthetic haze in image and video to create a realistic environment for evaluation the
                    performance of dehazing algorithms. The following overview.</p>
                <p>There are two main steps in the process of generating synthetic haze in image and video. The first
                    step is to estimate the depth of the scene. The second step is to generate the haze based on the
                    estimated depth. The following sections will introduce the two steps in detail.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>TCMonoDepth for Depth Estimation</li>
                    <li>SeeingThroughFog for generate the haze</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>TCMonoDepth for Depth Estimation</h3>
                <p>The first step in simulating haze conditions for images and videos is to estimate the depth of the
                    scene. TCMonoDepth is a method for stable depth estimation for any video.</p>

                <p>In this study, TCMonoDepth is employed to estimate depth information from the images extracted from
                    the BDD100K dataset. These depth maps are then used in conjunction with SeeingThroughFog to generate
                    haze conditions with varying densities, controlled by adjusting the beta parameter.</p>

                <p>By using TCMonoDepth for depth estimation, we ensure that the synthetic haze generation process is
                    more realistic, as it accounts for the spatial distribution of objects in the scene. This approach
                    allows for a more accurate evaluation of the dehazing techniques' performance when applied to video
                    data affected by haze conditions.
                </p>

                <h3>SeeingThroughFog for generate the haze</h3>
                <p>The second step in simulating haze conditions for images and videos is to generate the haze based on
                    the estimated depth. SeeingThroughFog is a method for generating synthetic haze in images and
                    videos.
                </p>

                <p>In this study, SeeingThroughFog is used in conjunction with TCMonoDepth to generate hazy images from
                    the BDD100K dataset using various beta values (0.05, 0.01, 0.02, 0.06). These hazy images are then
                    processed using different dehazing techniques, and their performance is evaluated using the
                    Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM). </p>

                <h2>Dehazing Techniques</h2>
                <p>
                    In this study, we evaluate the performance of several dehazing techniques when applied to hazy
                    images generated using TCMonoDepth and SeeingThroughFog. These techniques are designed to remove the
                    haze
                    and improve the visibility of the underlying scene. The dehazing methods considered in this study
                    include:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>MSBDN (Multi-Scale Bidirectional Dense Network)</li>
                    <li>Dehamer</li>
                    <li>Dehamer_indoor</li>
                    <li>DCP (Dark Channel Prior)</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>MSBDN (Multi-Scale Bidirectional Dense Network)</h3>
                <p>This is a Multi-Scale Boosted Dehazing Network with Dense Feature Fusion based on the U-Net
                    architecture to address the image dehazing problem.</p>
                <h3>Dehamer(Dehamer)</h3>
                <p>This is a DeHamer for single image dehazing that combines Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and
                    Transformer. </p>
                <h3>Dehamer_indoor</h3>
                <p>Ditto, with different training weight</p>
                <h3>DCP (Dark Channel Prior)</h3>
                <p>This is a Dark Channel Prior for single image haze removal that is based on the dark channel prior
                    model.</p>

                <h3>Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR)</h3>
                <p>
                    PSNR is a widely used metric to measure the quality of reconstructed or processed images by
                    comparing them to their original versions. It is defined as the ratio between the maximum possible
                    power of a signal and the power of corrupting noise that affects the fidelity of its representation.
                    PSNR is usually expressed in decibels (dB).
                </p>

                <p>
                    Higher PSNR values indicate better image quality, as they represent a lower level of noise or
                    distortion between the original and processed images. To calculate PSNR, first, the Mean Squared
                    Error (MSE) is computed, which measures the average squared differences between the pixel
                    intensities of the original and processed images. Then, PSNR is calculated using the following
                    formula:
                </p>

                <p>
                    PSNR = 10 * log10(MAX<sub>I</sub><sup>2</sup> / MSE)
                </p>

                <p>
                    where MAX<sub>I</sub> represents the maximum possible pixel value of the image. For an 8-bit image,
                    MAX<sub>I</sub> = 255. Note that PSNR is highly dependent on image content and may not always
                    correlate well with perceived image quality.
                </p>
                <h3>Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM)</h3>
                <p>
                    SSIM is calculated by comparing two images (e.g., a reference image and a processed image) and
                    quantifying the similarity in terms of luminance, contrast, and structural information. SSIM values
                    range from -1 to 1, with 1 indicating a perfect match between the two images.
                </p>
                <p>In this study, we will use SSIM to evaluate the performance of the selected dehazing techniques
                    (MSBDN, Dehamer, Dehamer_indoor, and DCP)by comparing the dehazed images with the original,
                    clear images from the BDD100K dataset. A higher SSIM value indicates better dehazing performance, as
                    it suggests that the processed image is more similar to the original image in terms of structure,
                    contrast, and luminance. This metric allows for a quantitative assessment of the dehazing
                    techniques' efficiency and effectiveness in restoring image quality under various haze conditions.

                <h3>Using TCMonoDepth for Video Depth Estimation and SeeingThroughFog for Haze Generation</h3>
                <p>After extraction the images from BDD100K dataset, we generate hazing images by applying TCMonoDepth
                    for video depth estimation and SeeingThroughFog for hazing generation.</p>

                <p>
                    Depth estimation with TCMonoDepth: For each extracted image, we use the TCMonoDepth method to
                    estimate the depth map. This depth map represents the distance between the camera and objects in the
                    scene, providing essential information for simulating realistic haze conditions. The advantage is
                    that TCMonoDepth is trained on a large dataset of synchronized stereo video data to accurately
                    estimate depth maps from single images
                </p>

                <p>
                    Then we use SeeingThroughFog for haze generation. Using the depth map generated by TCMonoDepth, we
                    can apply the SeeingThroughFog method to generate synchronized haze images with varying
                    densities. SeeingThroughFog uses the depth map and atmospheric properties defined by the beta
                    parameter to calculate the attenuation and scattering coefficients of the haze.The final fogged
                    image is produced by combining the input image and the fog layer created using these coefficients
                    with a depth-dependent blending function.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Various beta values: By varying the beta parameter in SeeingThroughFog, we produce hazy photos with
                    various fog densities in order to assess the effectiveness of dehazing procedures under various haze
                    situations. In this study, we represented a variety of haze densities from mild fog to deep fog
                    using four distinct beta values (0.05, 0.01, 0.02, 0.06).
                </p>

                <p>This is some Demo of the Haze Generation by using TCMonoDepth for Video Depth Estimation and
                    SeeingThroughFog for Haze Generation</p>

                <p>
                    We generate a realistic and diverse set of hazy images that closely resemble real-world haze
                    conditions by using TCMonoDepth for depth estimation and SeeingThroughFog for haze generation.
                    The
                    different beta values allow us to test the robustness of the dehazing techniques under different
                    haze densities, providing a thorough evaluation of their performance.

                <p>To evaluate the performance of the dehazing techniques, we use the SSIM metric to compare the

                    indicates better dehazing performance, as it suggests that the processed image is more similar to
                    the
                    original image in terms of structure, contrast, and luminance. This metric allows for a quantitative

                    various haze conditions.</p>

                <p>
                    To show the performance of the dehazing techniques, we have selected some images from
                    the BDD100K
                    dataset. The following images are the original hazy images and the dehazed images. The
                    dehazed
                    images are generated by the dehazing techniques. The dehazing techniques are MSBDN,
                    Dehamer,
                    Dehamer_indoor and DCP. These examples help demonstrate the overall visibility, color
                    fidelity,
                    and preservation of image details in the dehazed images.

                <h2>Performance Analysis</h2>

                <ul>
                    <li>MSBDN:</li>
                    <p>MSBDN demonstrates the best performance among the dehazing techniques, achieving the highest SSIM
                        scores (0.93, 0.92, and 0.68) and PSNR values (28.34 dB and 25.60 dB) for beta 0.01 and 0.02.
                        However, its PSNR drops significantly to 11.14 dB for beta 0.06. This indicates that while MSBDN
                        is highly effective at dehazing images with low to moderate haze density, its performance
                        degrades when dealing with more severe haze. Despite this, MSBDN still maintains the highest
                        SSIM score of 0.68 for beta 0.06, suggesting it preserves the structural similarity between the
                        dehazed and original images better than other techniques, even under more challenging
                        conditions.
                    </p>
                    <li>Dehamer:</li>
                    <p>
                        Dehamer shows good performance for low beta values (0.01 and 0.02) with SSIM scores of 0.91 and
                        0.87 and PSNR values of 25.77 dB and 21.72 dB, respectively. However, its performance drops
                        significantly for beta 0.06, with a PSNR value of 7.97 dB and an SSIM score of 0.57. This
                        suggests that Dehamer might struggle to handle severe haze conditions effectively, leading to a
                        decrease in image quality and preservation of structural similarity.
                    </p>

                    <li>Dehamer_indoor:</li>
                    <p>Dehamer_indoor exhibits relatively stable performance across all beta values. Its SSIM scores
                        range from 0.89 to 0.81, with a slight decrease as the haze density increases. It achieves the
                        highest PSNR value (18.43 dB) for beta 0.06, which indicates its ability to handle more severe
                        haze conditions better than the other techniques. Since Dehamer_indoor is specifically designed
                        for indoor environments, it is possible that its performance could be even better if applied to
                        a dataset consisting solely of indoor scenes. Nonetheless, its stable performance suggests that
                        it is a robust method for dehazing images under various haze densities.
                    </p>

                    <li>DCP:</li>
                    <p>DCP has the lowest PSNR values for beta 0.01 (18.41 dB) and 0.02 (19.06 dB) but maintains
                        relatively stable PSNR (18.68 dB) and SSIM scores (0.81, 0.84, and 0.82) across all beta values.
                        This indicates that while DCP might not be as effective in removing haze as the other
                        techniques, it still preserves the structural similarity between the dehazed and original images
                        under different haze conditions. However, its lower PSNR values suggest that the overall image
                        quality might be compromised when using DCP for dehazing.
                    </p>

                </ul>

                <br />
                <p>
                    In conclusion, each dehazing technique has its strengths and weaknesses, with MSBDN emerging as the
                    top performer in terms of both PSNR and SSIM. Dehamer_indoor shows stable performance across various
                    haze densities, and DCP maintains relatively stable SSIM scores, although it struggles with image
                    quality as indicated by the lower PSNR values. Understanding these differences can help guide the
                    selection of an appropriate dehazing technique for a specific application or scenario.

                            its superior SSIM performance for these haze densities. However, its PSNR score
                            significantly drops at a beta value of 0.06, further indicating its struggle with severe
                            haze conditions.
                        </li>
                        <li>Dehamer_indoor shows a consistent performance across all beta values, with slightly lower

                        <li>DCP has the lowest PSNR values for 0.01 and 0.02 beta values but exhibits a more stable
                            performance across different haze densities. At a beta value of 0.06, it performs better
                            than MSBDN in terms of PSNR.

                        <li>MSBDN achieves the highest SSIM scores for both 0.01 and 0.02 beta values, indicating its
                            superior performance in removing haze and preserving image details at these haze densities.
                        </li>
                        <li>However, at a beta value of 0.06, MSBDN's performance significantly decreases, while
                            Dehamer_indoor and DCP exhibit better SSIM scores. This suggests that MSBDN might struggle
                            in handling more severe haze conditions.
                        </li>

                            Dehamer_indoor performs consistently across all beta values, achieving slightly lower SSIM
                            scores compared to MSBDN for 0.01 and 0.02 but outperforming MSBDN at the highest haze

                </ul>
                <p>In conclusion, MSBDN shows the best performance in terms of SSIM and PSNR for lower haze densities
                    (beta values of 0.01 and 0.02), but struggles with severe haze conditions (beta value of 0.06).
                    Dehamer_indoor demonstrates a more consistent performance across all haze densities, with slightly
                    lower scores than MSBDN for lower haze densities but outperforming it at the highest haze density.
                    DCP, though exhibiting the lowest performance for lower haze densities, presents a more stable
                    performance across varying haze densities, surpassing MSBDN at the highest haze density.</p> -->
